Box for housing my nursery temperature sensor circuit.<br>
3-D models made in tinkercad to look like a fortress.<br>
2-D model laser cut out of a cardboard to look like a house. 
It is actually a huge piece of a single sheet which has been folded
along the edges. The edges have been etched to make folding easier.<br>
Kaleidoscope sides and end cap, laser cut from cardboard to make the chimney for the house.
Reflective surfaces made from aluminium foil cut and stuck to the end.<br>
Translucent end made from old plastic bags. (Not laser cut)<br>
Prism laser cut from extruded acrylic in 4 layers and stuck together.

The white 3-D printed box is built with exact dimensions to house the bread-board. The cardboard box was built as a 
prototype and a precursor for 3D printing. They have the same dimensions. The lid and the base for the 3-D printed box has been made separately since the tray did not have enough width to fit both together.
